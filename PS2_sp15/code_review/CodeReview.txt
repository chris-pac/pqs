The package name should be all lower case and extended to prevent conflicts in the future. 

Incorrect indentation all over the place.

*************************** *************************** ***************************
PostalAddress class has the following issue:

Constructor declares that it will throw an exception but doesn't and it doesn't 
check the validity of the input (i.e. null or empty).

The address is just reduced to three strings. No street name, no apartment number etc... 
these things are common enough that they should have been included as separate fields.

No javadocs for most of the methods.

Meaning of method names like getLine1, getLine2, etc.. is not easily understood. 

checkIO method doesn't do anything.

*************************** *************************** ***************************
EntryField class should probably have been an interface not abstract class.

*************************** *************************** ***************************
PhoneNumber class suffers from similar problems as PostalAddress.

checkIO returns false without doing anything while it returns true (without doing anything) in 
PostalAddressâ€¦ confusing and no comments.

PhoneNumber simplified to a single string.

*************************** *************************** ***************************
Note class has deficient javadocs (i.e. not descriptive enough or missing)


*************************** *************************** ***************************
InvalidIOException is an unnecessary custom exception class that is not even intuitively named 
for the 3 or 4 places that it shows up. Java has lots of exceptions that would have been more appropriate. 
For example IllegalArgumentException or NullPointerException.

 
*************************** *************************** ***************************
Entry class should override equals and hash code and maybe toString.

I'm not an expert in java but the members in Entry are final but getters return reference 
to those members. Defensive copies should have been made or those members themselves should 
have been made immutable.


*************************** *************************** ***************************
AddressBook problems:
Unhandled type safety warning.
Uses Serializable to save and load from file.
The enum declaration could have been avoided since we would probably want to search by individual 
fields like name or phone number and not an entire entry.

*************************** *************************** ***************************
/*********************************** Summary *************************************/

Deficient javadocs - very little documentation. No indication if getters will return null, empty or what.
No input checks in constructors or setters.
Primitive obsession(i.e. everything seems to be a string)
Warning not handled
Unnecessary exception class
Class members could have used more verbose names (i.e. instead of using ea or pn, email 
and phoneNumber should have been used).

The simple classes like Note, PhoneNumber, etc could have been made immutable.
